What’s Rocking AnimeUNSW! With all the recent events being fun with our AnimeSydney friends, we’re back to bringing some of our own events to you guys!

Due to popular turnout, we’re deciding to bring back our not-so-after school, afternoon tea time! Sadly, this time we still are lacking an all girl rock group, but we do have lots of teas, sweets and snacks to provide for you.

If you’re craving a sweet, or some smooth aromatic tea, or a place to chill out with your fellow AnimeUNSW friends, then this is the perfect event for you to unwind from the stress of uni as mid-sem approaches.

Pricing for Houkago Tea Time is as follows:
$2 for AUNSW Members
$3 for non-AUNSW but Arc Members
$5 for non-Arc Members

Hope to see you all there!
