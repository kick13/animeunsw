title: Post-AGM GARYOAKE
subtitle: 27 September at 12 pm
location: Echo Point Karaoke, 262 Pitt Street, Sydney
summary: We know, karaoke is long overdue. SO - after an exhausting night of cruel and unusual interrogation at our Annual General Meeting (just kidding! Or are we?), what's better than six hours of continuous noise-making and vocal destruction to celebrate the appointment of the new exec team of 2015?

We know, karaoke is long overdue. SO - after an exhausting night of cruel and unusual interrogation at our Annual General Meeting (just kidding! Or are we?), what's better than six hours of continuous noise-making and vocal destruction to celebrate the appointment of the new exec team of 2015?

Even if you can't attend the AGM, feel free to join us in releasing your mid-sem assessment stress in a delightfully angry rendition of Colors (or any other song, for that matter)!

As usual, there will be an English room for those who prefer not to sing in Japanese, so there really is no reason for anyone to not turn up!

Remember to bring romaji lyrics (on phone, tablet or good old paper) if you need them, as all Japanese song lyrics will be in Japanese.

If you don't know how to get there, meet us in front of QVB at 11:50am, and we'll walk you there. If you don't know how to get to QVB, post below and let us know! We'll get you there some way or another.

(Helpful Hint: Keep your evening free - dinner event details TBA!!)

When: 12am-6pm, Saturday, 27th of September (Week 9)
Where: Echo Point Karaoke (262 Pitt Street, Sydney) or meet in front of QVB at 11:50am
Price: $10 + the price of one drink

Hope to see (and hear!) you all there!!
