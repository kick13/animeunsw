# About us

AnimeUNSW was formed in 1997 by three financially-challenged anime enthusiasts looking to support their passion. Now it is Sydney's largest anime club, catering to members from all across the city.

AnimeUNSW's goal is to unite all like-minded people together to enjoy anime and all things related, including but not limited to manga, drawing, games, costume play and music.
