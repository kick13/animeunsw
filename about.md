AnimeUNSW was formed in 1997 by three financially-challenged anime enthusiasts looking to support their passion. Now it is Sydney's largest anime club, catering to members from all across the city.

AnimeUNSW's goal is to unite all like-minded people together to enjoy anime and all things related, including but not limited to manga, drawing, games, costume play and music.

## What do we do?

Our activities include:

- Screening Sessions every Friday
- Gaming Sessions every Tuesday
- Art Sessions every Wednesday
- Eat-Out & Karaoke Socials
- Pre/Post-Exam Shindigs
- Gunpla
- Club fundraising campaigns at various local conventions (e.g. SMASH!)
- Unique & experimental events (e.g. cosplay makeup workshops)

## Who looks after AnimeUNSW?
