# How to events!
# ==============
#
# Basically go with the layout like below and you should be fine!
# For each event, you'll need to provide an id and width.
#
# - The id will be used to determine the event file and image. So for
#   example, if you give `id: jibun-wo`, then it'll be assumed that the
#   event information is at:
#       website/_events/jibun-wo.md
#   and that the event image is at:
#       website/images/events/jibun-wo.png
#       website/images/events/jibun-wo@2x.png (optional)
#
# - The width will specify how much room the event will take on the page.
#   Right now, you can use 1x, 2x, and fill. Anything else might result in
#   weirdness showing up.
#
# It's totally okay if you mess up! If you know how to build the website
# locally, give it a shot first, and if you don't... or you're feeling lazy,
# there's always that magical undo button, right :)
